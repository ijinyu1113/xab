# X-ab: Detecting abnormality in chest X-ray images

An automatic diagnosis of lung diseases from chest x-ray images has been researched based on deep learning technology. However, existing deep learning models have faced difficulties in correctly diagnosing lung diseases, due to (1) the diversities of the diseases and (2) the difficulties in correctly localizing the abnormal spots in X-ray images. For example, for VinBigData [Nguyen et al, 2021], the best accuracy achieved is 36.5% for classifying 15 diseases from chest X-ray images. We aim to develop deep learning models that detect or prescreen abnormality in chest X-ray images, which is supposed to be easier than classifying the diverse diseases. This model can be used for AI health checkup, and those prescreened as abnormal can be sent to a doctor for further inspection.

There are a few technical challenges in developing the prescreening model, which are, (1) how to detect normal images without object detection, as object detection is much difficult and normal images are just those not having abnormal spots; (2) how to deal with the class imbalance problem, as there are much more normal images than abnormal images in practice, so the model could be easily biased toward normal if trained without caution; and (3) how to estimate the confidence of each prediction (or the probability of being abnormal), as a prediction without confidnce is difficult to trust in patients. To address these challenges, I developed a deep learning model, combining EfficientNet [Tan et al, 2019] and a cost-sensitive learning [Lin et al, 2017]. The model showed over 94% f1-score on VinBigData. I am currently working on model calibration [Guo et al, 2017] to estimate the prediction confidence.
